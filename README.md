[00:19.67] I see her online, all the time
[00:26.88] I'm trying not to stare down there
[00:29.89] While she talks about her tough time
[00:34.67] Girl of your dreams, you know what I mean
[00:42.11] There's something 'bout her stare that makes you nervous
[00:45.13] And you say things that you don't mean
[01:04.13] 
[00:49.91] Well, I found my hotel, I called up the twins
[00:53.41] It's seven in the morning, so they won't let me in
[00:57.29] I need to get back, I've gotta see the girl on the screen
[01:04.20] (And then I phoned her and she said)
[01:22.20] 
[01:05.86] "Well, maybe I would like you better if you took off your clothes
[01:12.56] I'm not playing with you, baby, I think that you should give it a go"
[01:20.05] She said, "Maybe I would like you better if you took off your clothes
[01:27.56] I wanna see and stop thinking, if you're too shy then let me
[01:32.18] Too shy then let me know"
[01:44.68] 
[01:40.22] I've been wearing nothing every time I call you
[01:45.43] And I'm starting to feel weird about it
[01:47.53] Sometimes it's better if you think about it
[01:51.09] This time, I think I'm gonna drink through it
[01:55.13] But I see her online, and I don't think that I should be calling
[01:58.80] All the time, I just wanted a happy ending
[02:02.62] And I'm pretending I don't care 'bout her stare
[02:05.33] While she's giving me a tough time
[02:22.33] 
[02:10.19] Well, I found a motel, it looked like the bins
[02:13.67] I think there'd been a murder, so we couldn't get in
[02:17.35] I need to get back, I gotta see the girl on the screen
[02:44.35] 
[02:25.20] "And maybe I would like you better if you took off your clothes
[02:32.74] I'm not playing with you, baby, I think that you should give it a go"
[02:39.98] She said, "Maybe I would like you better if you took off your clothes
[02:48.06] I wanna see and stop thinking, if you're too shy then let me
[02:53.35] Too shy then let me know (Too shy then let me)
[02:59.13] But if you're too shy then let me know (Too shy then let me)
[03:01.06] If you're too shy then let me go" (Oh, yeah)
[03:23.06] 
[03:05.85] I see her online
[03:09.60] All the time
[03:15.60] 
[03:26.56] She said, "Maybe I would like you better if you took off your clothes
[03:34.07] I'm not playing with you, baby, I think that you should give it a go"
[03:41.31] She said, "Maybe I would like you better if you took off your clothes
[03:49.68] I wanna see and stop thinking, if you're too shy then let me
[03:53.35] Too shy then let me know"
